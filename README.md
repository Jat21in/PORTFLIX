    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd portflix
    ```

    npm install
    ```

3.  **Populate your data:**
    Edit the data in `data/projects.json`, `data/skills.json`, etc., to reflect your personal projects and information. Alternatively, integrate with a headless CMS (see Customization section).

4.  **Run the development server:**

## 🎨 Customization & Enhancements

### Content Management
-   **Local JSON**: The project starts with local JSON files (`data/`) for projects, skills, and about information. This is great for quick setup.
-   **Headless CMS Integration**: For more dynamic content management, consider integrating with a headless CMS like:
    - **Sanity.io**
    - **Strapi**
    - **Contentful**
    - This would allow you to update your portfolio content without touching the code.

### Theming
Tailor the look and feel of your PORTFLIX:
-   Modify `app/globals.css` for global styles.
-   Adjust `tailwind.config.js` for theme configuration, custom colors, and font palettes to match your personal brand.
-   Style individual components for specific visual tweaks and Netflix-like elements (e.g., button styles, overlay effects).

### Adding Features
Expand your PORTFLIX's capabilities:
-   **Personalized Recommendations**: Implement a simple algorithm to "recommend" projects based on categories viewed.
-   **More "Browse" Categories**: Add sections for blog posts, testimonials, or services offered.
-   **Trailer-like Previews**: For video projects, embed short video previews that play on hover.
-   **User Authentication (for admin)**: If you want to manage content directly from the app, add a simple admin login.
-   **Language Switcher**: If you target a multi-lingual audience.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

This application is optimized for deployment on modern platforms:
-   **Vercel** (highly recommended for Next.js projects)
-   **Netlify**
-   **AWS Amplify**

### Environment Setup

If you integrate with a headless CMS or any third-party service, remember to:
1.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
2.  Add your API credentials and relevant environment variables to this file (consult the specific service's documentation for required keys).
3.  Ensure these variables are properly accessed in your Next.js application.
